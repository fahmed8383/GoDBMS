% \section{General Information}

% \subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide the outcome of the testing methods that were laid out in the Test Plan document. This document includes the assessment of how successful the Functional and Non Functional requirements that were created during the development process and the traceability of those requirements throughout the process.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}
The original implementation was well tested but there were no documentations to support the tests. Additionally the original implementation also did not have any non functional tests. Though the original implementation was well tested from a functional testing standpoint, the lack of traceability to the requirements did not raise confidence in the correctness of the software. In our implementation, the requirements were well documented and divided up into modules that were tested to an equal degree to the original implementation. Due to the use of documentation and explicitly identifying our requirements, which allowed us to trace our tests back to the requirements and be confident that we had successfully achieved our requirements. Our implementation also included various NFR tests which also increased our confidence in the correctness of the implementation.

\section{Unit Testing}
Unit testing was heavily implemented to ensure confidence in the functionality of each component of our code. As the individual software units comprised a much larger system, it was important to build confidence in the lower level functionality so that error tracing efforts would be efficient for system wide testing.

\section{Changes Due To Testing}
Testing did not uncover a cause to deeply reframe the architectural decisions or design patterns. However, rigorous test cases revealed local code bugs such as syntax errors, type mismatches and minor logic errors that were promptly addressed. Testing also revealed edge cases and necessary error handling. 

\section{Automated Testing}
Our test plan was heavily automated testing using the Go test library. This reduced manual labour efforts and time resource consumption, and provided instant results right in the IDE. We used nearly 700 lines of automated testing scripts to ensure thorough testing.
